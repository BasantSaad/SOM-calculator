# Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Application

## Overview
This project implements a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Matplotlib for visualization. It allows users to input training data and initial weights, configure learning parameters, and visualize the training process.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
- Supports manual input of training data and initial weights.
- Configurable learning rate and iteration count.
- Displays training progress and final weights.
- Visualizes the training data, initial weights, and updated weights using Matplotlib.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tkinter
```

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python som_gui.py
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Enter training data (each row as a new line, values separated by commas).
2. Enter initial weights in the same format.
3. Set the learning rate and number of iterations.
4. Click the **Run Algorithm** button.
5. View the updated weights and graphical visualization.
